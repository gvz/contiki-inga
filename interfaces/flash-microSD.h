 * \defgroup microSD_interface MicroSD Card Interface
 *
 *	\note This sd-card interface is based on the work of Ulrich Radig
 *	      "Connect AVR to MMC/SD" and was a little bit modified plus
 *	      adapted to the mspi-drv
 *
 * <p> Huge memory space is always nice to have, because you don't have to
 * decide which data has to be stored, just store everything! Furthermore you
 * can buffer your data, whenever wireless connection breaks down.
 * An easy and modular way is a SD card. For smaller applications (like
 * sensor nodes), the tiny version "microSD" would be the best choice. Both, the
 * "big" SD-Cards and the microSD-Cards can be interfaced by SPI and use the same
 * Instruction set, so this interface can be used for both SD-Card types.</p>
