X Cluster functions to source files
X Include number of callsites in edges
X Output complete runtime in profiler
X Count only time spent in function without the subcalls
X Highlight certain functions
X Filter out/in certain function names
* Add option(s) to cluster/show callsites of only certain files/functions
* Make limits, etc. configurable (colouring/style)
* Verify the duration and increase resolution
* Wrapper for "system" calls --wrap linker option (automatic macros with __builtin_apply?)
* What effect does inlining have? - Function no longer visible
* Calculate percent over complete runtime
* Fraction of time spent calling subfunctions
* Binary search
* Implement a stack for instrumented functions
* Record based nodes: http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html
* Transparency for nodes/edges
